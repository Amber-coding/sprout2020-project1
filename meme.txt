Below is my opinion about Sprout2020.
---
I am very happy that I could be a person in Sprout2020. Thank you for accepting me to Sprout !!!
-
I learned a lot of things in Sprout2020. Especially coding skills, for instance, how to correct using fundamental data type, how to create functions, and so on. And I also thought Sprout not only let me know about "coding", but also "attitude". Before I joined Sprout, I was a person who is very easy to give up when I couldn't find bugs in my code or don't have any idea about the problem. But after I joined Sprout, I "need" to find the bugs in my code and never give up whether I have clue or not, or I can't get the score to pass Sprout. That made me more serious and persist in coding, because of this right attitude, I promote up a lot in coding this season !!! Also, I have a greater interest in coding because of Sprout2020!!!
-
Hope that I could make more progress, and still keep my coding interesting in the future !!! Fighting !!!
